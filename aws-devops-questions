âœ… Tips for 4+ years experience:

Expect scenario-based troubleshooting questions (EKS pod failures, pipeline rollbacks, infra drift).

Be prepared with STAR-format answers for real challenges you solved (e.g., cost optimization, deployment failures, infra automation).

Hands-on knowledge of Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines integrated with AWS is often tested.
